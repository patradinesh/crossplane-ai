**AI Mode**: Benefits from OpenAI's constantly evolving knowledge and training

## üß™ Test with Your OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Set Your API Key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key
```

### Step 2: Compare Template vs AI Mode

#### Simple Question (Shows Basic Difference)
```bash
# Template Mode
./crossplane-ai ask "What resources do I have?"

# AI Mode  
OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY ./crossplane-ai --config ./config.yaml ask "What resources do I have?"
```

#### Complex Troubleshooting (Shows AI Advantage)
```bash
# Template Mode - Generic response
./crossplane-ai ask "My database keeps disconnecting and pods restart every few minutes. What could be wrong?"

# AI Mode - Intelligent analysis
OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY ./crossplane-ai --config ./config.yaml ask "My database keeps disconnecting and pods restart every few minutes. What could be wrong?"
```

#### Advanced Manifest Generation (Shows AI Power)
```bash
# Template Mode - Basic template
./crossplane-ai generate "highly available PostgreSQL with read replicas for production"

# AI Mode - Intelligent, comprehensive manifest
OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY ./crossplane-ai --config ./config.yaml generate "highly available PostgreSQL with read replicas for production"
```

### Step 3: Run Comprehensive Comparison
```bash
./ai-comparison-test.sh
```

## üöÄ Real-World Examples Where AI Excels

### Example 1: Database Performance Issues
**Template**: "Check your database configuration"
**AI**: "Based on your symptoms, this appears to be a connection pool exhaustion issue. Here's how to diagnose: 1) Check connection limits with `kubectl logs`, 2) Verify pool settings in your DBInstance spec, 3) Monitor connection metrics..."

### Example 2: Cost Optimization
**Template**: "Consider using smaller instances"  
**AI**: "I've analyzed your resource usage patterns. You can reduce costs by 40% by: 1) Moving dev/test databases to burstable instances, 2) Implementing automated start/stop schedules, 3) Using spot instances for non-critical workloads..."

### Example 3: Security Hardening
**Template**: "Enable encryption"
**AI**: "Your current setup has several security gaps: 1) Database encryption at rest is disabled, 2) Network policies are too permissive, 3) Secrets are not using external secret management. Here's a prioritized remediation plan..."
